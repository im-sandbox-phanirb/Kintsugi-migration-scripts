# Branch Management on GitHub

## Viewing Branches in Your Repository

1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. From the file tree view on the left, select the **branch dropdown menu**, then click **View all branches**. You can also find the branch dropdown menu at the top of the integrated file editor.

### Branch Views

- **Your branches:** Shows all branches youâ€™ve pushed to (excluding the default branch), with the most recent branches first. Available in repositories where you have push access.
- **Active branches:** Shows all branches (excluding the default branch) that anyone has committed to within the last three months, ordered by the most recent commits.
- **Stale branches:** Shows all branches that no one has committed to in the last three months, ordered by the oldest commits. Use this list to identify branches to delete.
- **All branches:** Shows the default branch followed by all other branches, ordered by the most recent commits.

### Searching for Branches

Use the search field in the top right to perform a simple, case-insensitive, sub-string search on branch names. Advanced query syntax is not supported.

## Updating a Local Clone After a Branch Name Changes

After renaming a branch on GitHub, collaborators with a local clone must update their clone:

```bash
git branch -m OLD-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME
git fetch origin
git branch -u origin/NEW-BRANCH-NAME NEW-BRANCH-NAME
git remote set-head origin -a
```

Optionally, remove tracking references to the old branch name:

```bash
git remote prune origin
```
