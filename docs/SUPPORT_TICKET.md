# Raising support ticket

## Creating a support ticket using the GitHub Support portal
- Navigate to the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) and choose one of the following options:
    - To sign in with your GitHub account, click **Sign in with GitHub**.
- Select the enterprise account dropdown menu and click the name of the account your support ticket is regarding.
- Select the From dropdown menu and click the email address you'd like GitHub Support to contact.

    - Adding CC emails to your ticket:

        - An admin or a support entitled user can add up to 10 additional email addresses to a ticket on CC directly from the ticket form.
        - To add more email addresses, loop them in directly via email.
    - CC recipientsâ€™ abilities:

        - Those on CC can read every conversation and attachment related to the ticket.
        - They can also send a reply to the ticket.
    - Support Portal visibility:

        - CCing an email address does not automatically display the ticket in the support portal for that email address.
    - Admins, support entitled users:
        - Admins and support entitled users can view tickets created by members of their enterprise or organization on the portal. However, they still need to be CCâ€™d on such tickets to be able to comment on them.
- Select the Product dropdown menu and click GitHub Enterprise Server (self-hosted).
- If prompted, select the Server installation dropdown menu and click the installation your support ticket is regarding. If the installation is not listed, click Other.
- Select the Release series dropdown menu and click the release your GitHub Enterprise Server instance is running.
- Select the Type of Issue dropdown menu and click the appropriate circumstance.
- Optionally, if your account includes GitHub Premium Support and your ticket is about a system failure or a critical outage currently blocking business operations in production, you can request a callback in English. Select **Request a callback from GitHub Support**, select the country code dropdown menu to choose your country, and enter your phone number.
- Under "Subject", type a descriptive title for the issue you're having.
- Under "How can we help", provide any additional information that will help the Support team troubleshoot the problem. You can use markdown to format your message.
- Optionally, attach diagnostics files and other files by dragging and dropping, uploading, or pasting from the clipboard.
- Click **Send request**.
