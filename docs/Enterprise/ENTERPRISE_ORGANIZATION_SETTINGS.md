## Configuring Visibility for Organization Membership

2. On the left side of the page, in the enterprise account sidebar, click **Policies**.
3. Under **Policies**, click **Options**.
4. Under **Default organization membership visibility**, select the drop-down menu, and click **Private** or **Public**.
5. Optionally, to prevent members from changing their membership visibility from the default, select **Enforce for all enterprise members**.
6. To enforce the new setting on all existing members, use the `ghe-org-membership-update` command-line utility.
